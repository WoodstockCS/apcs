    <h1>AP Computer Science</h1>
    <p>Instructor: Andrew Smith <a href="mailto:AndrewSmith@wcsu.net">AndrewSmith@wcsu.net</a></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Are you ready?</h3>
<p>Before starting this course you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>some basic programming skills</b>: you should start the year with a good grasp of some basic fundamentals in programming, like functions, booleans, and lists</li>
    <li><b>a pro-active approach to self-learning</b>: when you feel stuck, you should feel comfortable finding help in books or online resources</li>
    <li><b>good team skills</b>: contrary to popular belief, programming is not a solitary task. you should be able to work together with -- and serve as a resource for -- your fellow programmers in the course
    <li><b>good work habits</b>: this course is not easy, so you should be willing to work hard and effectively</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take another look at that first one, about programming skills. This is not an intro class, so you need to have some experience before the class starts. Most students get this experience by taking Computer Programming at WUHS, but some students get this experience elsewhere. The following steps show you how to check whether your experience has given you the pre-requisite skills. You should feel comfortable doing the problems mentioned below --OR-- you should feel comfortable doing the self-learning to figure them out. There are good help links on each problem page.</i></p>

    <ol>
      <li>go to codingbat.com</li>
      <li>create an account using your school email address</li>
      <li>once you're logged in (make sure you're logged in!), click 'prefs' in the upper right</li>
      <li>under the "Teacher Share" header, type andrewsmith@wcsu.net, and click 'share'</li>
      <li>go back to the main codingbat page (click the site title in the upper left)</li>
      <li>there's a java tab and a python tab. make sure you are in the java tab</li>
      <li>go to each of these sections -- String-1, Array-1, and Logic-1 -- and try your best on the top two problems in each column</li>
      <ul>
	<li>IMPORTANT: make sure you are logged in! look in the upper right corner</li>
	<li>that's 6 problems per section, for a total of 18 problems</li>
	<li>keep adapting code and clicking 'go' until you get all green tests.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>when you're done (or you give up), send Mr. Smith an email so he can have a look</li>
    </ol>
